The Man of Today

He seduced the Earth,

He absorbed it too,

He no longer fears Hell,

Nor the seas either,

Today, a new day,

A new era,

The gods bow down to this being who is better than them,

Today, Man is stronger,

The thief of fire committed a great crime against the gods,

That of betraying them by creating a fatal enemy,

Man bringing defeat to all things, 

If he does not feed himself, he destroys himself,

He still says: fear the gods,

But has he forgotten that they are all suffocating in waste,

In the seas, Poseidon swallows plastic,

In the heavens, Uranus and the gods of Olympus no longer breathe,

On Earth, Gaia is disintegrated by nuclear power,

In music, Apollo is horrified by today's music,

Only Man is responsible for the loss of the gods,

Today's Man is much stronger than all the others,

So strong that he risks his own destruction.
