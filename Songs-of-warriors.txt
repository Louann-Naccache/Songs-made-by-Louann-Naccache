Warriors !
Listen to me :

Today is a great day. 

The day where mankind seduced the Earth, he absorbed it too. 

He is no longer fearing hell : Yeah ! 

Nor the seas either ! 

Today, is a new day ! 

Yeaah ! 

A new era ! 

Yeeaah ! 

Where the Gods bow down to this being who is better than them. 

Yeeah ! 

Today, Today, Man's stronger, stronger than ever ! 

Yeeeaah! 

Prometheus has helped us to build a great nation ! 
You are not totally wrong ! 

He has been tortured ! (In purpose) To create a powerful a powerful specy ! 

Man ! Man ! That is destroying all the Olympus ! 

Man that has defeated all the Gods ! 

Glory to Man ! 

Now is more powerful than all of them ! 

Are you with me ? Are with me !? Yeah ! Yeah ! Yeah ! Yeah Yeah ! Yeahhh ! 

Someone says that "you should fear Gods ! " 

Nooo ! 

But he has forgotten that they are all suffocating in waste ! Yeah ! 

In the seas, Poseidon swallows plastic,

Yeah !

In the heavens, Uranus and the gods of Olympus no longer breathe,

Yeeaah !

On Earth, Gaia is disintegrated by nuclear power,

Yeeeeaaah !

In music, Apollo is horrified by today's music !

Yeeah !

Only Man, only Man, only Mankind is responsible for the loss of the gods, the loss of the stability of all the Universe ! Of the Cosmos ! 

Who is greater than Man ?!!

Today's Man is much stronger than all the others ! 

So strong that he risks his own destruction !!!

Will you let other people destroy you !?

Nooo !!!

Will you let humankind perish for his own existence !

Nooooo !

Then unify all of us together ! 

Yeah ! 
Yeah ! 
Yeah ! 
Yeah ! 
Yeah !
